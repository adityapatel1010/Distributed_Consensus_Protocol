# Distributed Consensus Protocols

This project is an in-depth implementation and evaluation of **distributed consensus protocols** designed to ensure **reliability, consistency, and fault tolerance** in distributed systems. It explores both crash-fault-tolerant and Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus mechanisms through practical implementations and performance analysis.

The system focuses on understanding how modern distributed systems maintain agreement across unreliable networks and nodes while scaling to high-throughput workloads.

## 🔍 Overview

Consensus lies at the core of distributed systems, enabling multiple nodes to agree on shared state despite failures. This project implements and evaluates three foundational consensus protocols:

- **Paxos** – for crash fault tolerance and leader-based agreement  
- **Raft** – for understandable and maintainable consensus with strong leader semantics  
- **PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** – for resilience against malicious or Byzantine failures  
- **Scalable Database System** – for resilience against malicious or Byzantine failures  

Each protocol is engineered to highlight its design principles, fault-handling behavior, and performance trade-offs.
